## Frontend development
Frontend development is about building websites that look good and work smoothly. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you design and implement the parts of a website that users directly interact with.
HTML gives structure, CSS adds style, and JavaScript adds functionality. 
Your aim is to ensure websites are visually appealing and function well on various devices and browsers, providing a positive user experience.
